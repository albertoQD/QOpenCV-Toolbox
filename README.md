Computer Vision toolbox written in C++ Using Qt and the OpenCV Library. The
very basic scheme of the application was taken from qt-opencv-multithreaded
[https://code.google.com/p/qt-opencv-multithreaded/downloads/list] in its
version 1.21. But I changed and added lot of new things. 

There are two modules: An image processing toolbox and the stereo vision
toolbox (in which I also add a single-camera calibration option).

The toolbox works with real time video (from a webcam for instance), video
files and image files.
